  Hydraulic Status:
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     0:00:00: Balancing the network:
              Trial  1: relative flow change = 0.928415
              Trial  2: relative flow change = 1.072474
              PRV 5 switched from active to closed
              FCV 4 switched from active to open
              Trial  3: relative flow change = 77.341455
              Trial  4: relative flow change = 0.000004
     0:00:00: Balanced after 4 trials
     0:00:00: Reservoir 1 is closed
     0:00:00: Reservoir 6 is closed
     0:00:00: FCV 4 open but cannot deliver flow
     0:00:00: PRV 5 closed
