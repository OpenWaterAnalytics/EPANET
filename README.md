EPANET   {#epanet_readme}
======

The EPANET Library is a pressurized pipe network hydraulic and water quality analysis toolkit written in C. 

__Note:__ This repository is not affiliated with, or endorsed by, the USEPA. For the "official" release of EPANET (2.00.12 UI and Toolkit) please go to the [EPA's GitHub repo](https://github.com/USEPA/Water-Distribution-Network-Model) or [the USEPA website](http://www2.epa.gov/water-research/epanet). It is also not the graphical user interface version. This is the hydraulic and water quality solver engine.

However, if you are interested in extending EPANET for academic, personal, or commercial use, then you've come to the right place. For community discussion, FAQ, and roadmapping of the project, go to the [Community Forum](http://community.wateranalytics.org/category/epanet).
