## What is on this Repository?
The EPANET Library is a pressurized pipe network hydraulic and water quality analysis toolkit written in C. If you are interested in using/extending EPANET for academic, personal, or commercial use, then you've come to the right place.

Please see the [`version 2.1` Release Notes](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/EPANET/blob/master/ReleaseNotes2_1.md) for information relevant to users of the previous official version (2.00.12). If you would like to contribute by addressing any of the outstanding [Issues](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/EPANET/issues), then please comment on the Issue, then Fork this repo to your own account and base your commits on the [`dev` branch](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/EPANET/tree/dev). Once you are finished, you can open a Pull Request to test the code and discuss merging your changes back into the community respository.

A step-by-step tutorial on how to contribute to EPANET using GitHub is also [available](http://www.slideshare.net/demetriseliades/contributing-to-epanet-using-github-in-windows).

__Note:__ This repository is not affiliated with, or endorsed by, the USEPA. For the last "official" release of EPANET (2.00.12 UI and Toolkit) please go to the [EPA's GitHub repo](https://github.com/USEPA/Water-Distribution-Network-Model) or [the USEPA website](http://www2.epa.gov/water-research/epanet). It is also not the graphical user interface version. This is the hydraulic and water quality solver engine.

However, if you are interested in extending EPANET for academic, personal, or commercial use, then you've come to the right place. For community discussion, FAQ, and roadmapping of the project, go to the [Community Forum](http://community.wateranalytics.org/category/epanet).
