ORD Water Distribution Network Model (AKA "EPANET")

Introduction
------------
This is the official EPANET source code repository maintained by US EPA ORD, NRMRL, Water Supply and Water Resources Division located in Cincinnati, Ohio.

EPANET performs extended period simulation of hydraulics and water quality within potable water distribution networks. EPANET source code is written in the C Programming Language and released in the Public Domain.

Lewis Rossman created EPANET in the early 1990s and actively developed and maintained the project until 2008. Over the intervening years he received support from too many members of the WDS modeling community to name individually. 
 
Intended Audience
-----------------
The intended audience for this repository can be divided roughly into two groups:
 
 - Programmers interested in water distribution system modeling
 - Engineers working on water distribution system modeling interested in programming
 
Git Hub and software repositories are geared towards people with software development experience. If you've ever hacked EPANET or built a Matlab script for running hydraulic simulations, you may find the contents of this repository helpful. We encourage you to fork EPANET and develop a great new feature to share with the community.

The source code distributed here is identical to the code found at the official [EPANET Website](http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/wswrd/dw/epanet.html). 

Active Development
------------------
We are actively developing features in the following areas:
 - Real Time Monitoring
 - Water Quality
