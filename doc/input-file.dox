/**
@page InpFile Input File
The Input file is a standard EPANET input data file that describes the system being analyzed. It can either be created external to the application being developed with the Toolkit or by the application itself. It is the first file name supplied to the @ref EN_open function. A project's data associated with its Input file remains accessible until the project is closed down with the @ref EN_close or deleted with @ref EN_deleteproject. 

The file is organized by sections where each section begins with a keyword enclosed in brackets. The various keywords are listed below. Click on a section to see the format of the data it contains.

The order of sections is not important. However, whenever a node or link is referred to in a section it must have already been defined in the [JUNCTIONS], [RESERVOIRS], [TANKS], [PIPES], [PUMPS], or [VALVES] sections. Thus it is recommended that these sections be placed first.

Each section can contain one or more lines of data. Blank lines can appear anywhere in the file and the semicolon (;) can be used to indicate that what follows on the line is a comment, not data. A maximum of 1024 characters can appear on a line.

The ID labels used to identify nodes, links, curves and patterns can be any combination of up to 31 characters and numbers.

__Definitions:__

<B>UNITS</B> sets the units in which flow rates are expressed where:
- \b CFS = cubic feet per second
- \b GPM = gallons per minute
- \b MGD = million gallons per day
- \b IMGD = Imperial MGD
- \b AFD = acre-feet per day
- \b LPS = liters per second
- \b LPM = liters per minute
- \b MLD = million liters per day
- \b CMH = cubic meters per hour
- \b CMD = cubic meters per day

For <b>CFS, GPM, MGD, IMGD</b>, and <b>AFD</b> other input quantities are expressed in US Customary Units. If flow units are in liters or cubic meters then Metric Units must be used for all other input quantities as well. (See the @ref Units topic). The default flow units are \b GPM.

\b HEADLOSS selects a formula to use for computing head loss for flow through a pipe. The choices are the Hazen-Williams (\b H-W ), Darcy-Weisbach (\b D-W ), or Chezy-Manning (\b C-M ) formulas. The default is \b H-W.

The \b HYDRAULICS option allows you to either <B>SAVE</B> the current hydraulics solution to a file or \b USE a previously saved hydraulics solution. This is useful when studying factors that only affect water quality behavior.

\b VISCOSITY is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid being modeled relative to that of water at 20 deg. C (1.0 centistoke). The default value is 1.0.

\b SPECIFIC GRAVITY is the ratio of the density of the fluid being modeled to that of water at 4 deg. C (unitless). The default value is 1.0.

\b TRIALS are the maximum number of trials used to solve network hydraulics at each hydraulic time step of a simulation. The default is 40.

\b ACCURACY prescribes the convergence criterion that determines when a hydraulic solution has been reached. The trials end when the sum of all flow changes from the previous solution divided by the total flow in all links is less than this number. The default is 0.001.

\b FLOWCHANGE is a similar convergence criterion requiring that the largest absolute flow change between the current and previous solutions be less than the specified value (in flow units). The default is 0 which means that this criterion is not used. 

\b HEADERROR is yet another convergence criterion requiring that the head loss computed by the head loss formula compared to the difference in nodal heads across each link be less than the specified value (in ft or m). The default is 0 which means that this criterion is not used.

\b CHECKFREQ sets the number of solution trials that pass during hydraulic balancing before the status of pumps, check valves, flow control valves and pipes connected to tanks are once again updated. The default value is 2, meaning that status checks are made every other trial.

\b MAXCHECK is the number of solution trials after which periodic status checks are discontinued. Instead, a status check is made only after convergence is achieved. The default value is 10, meaning that after 10 trials, instead of checking status every \b CHECKFREQ trials, status is checked only at convergence.

\b DAMPLIMIT is the accuracy value at which solution damping and status checks on PRVs and PSVs should begin. Damping limits all flow changes to 60% of what they would otherwise be as future trials unfold. The default is 0 which indicates that no damping should be used and that status checks on control valves are made at every iteration.

\b UNBALANCED determines what happens if a hydraulic solution cannot be reached within the prescribed number of \b TRIALS at some hydraulic time step into the simulation. \b STOP will halt the entire analysis at that point. \b CONTINUE will continue the analysis with a warning message issued. <b>CONTINUE n</b> will continue the search for a solution for another \b n trials with the status of all links held fixed at their current settings. The simulation will be continued at this point with a message issued about whether convergence was achieved or not. The default choice is \b STOP.

\b DEMAND MODEL specifies whether a demand driven analysis ( \b DDA ) or a pressure driven analysis ( \b PDA ) should be made. Under \b DDA full nodal demands are always met even if negative pressures result. \b PDA assumes that demand varies between 0 and its full value as a power function of nodal pressure. The default demand model is \b DDA.

\b MINIMUM PRESSURE is the pressure below which no demand can be delivered under a pressure driven analysis. It has no effect on a demand driven analysis. Its default value is 0.

\b REQUIRED PRESSURE is the pressure required to supply a node's full demand under a pressure driven analysis. It has no effect on a demand driven analysis. Its default value is 0.

\b PRESSURE EXPONENT is the power to which pressure is raised when computing the demand delivered to a node under a pressure driven analysis. It has no effect on a demand driven analysis. Its default value is 0.5.

\b PATTERN provides the ID label of a default demand pattern to be applied to all junctions where no demand pattern was specified. If no such pattern exists in the \b [PATTERNS] section then by default the pattern consists of a single multiplier equal to 1.0. If this option is not used, then the global default demand pattern has a label of "1".

The <b>DEMAND MULTIPLIER</b> is used to adjust the values of baseline demands for all junctions and all demand categories. For example, a value of 2 doubles all baseline demands, while a value of 0.5 would halve them. The default value is 1.0.

<b>EMITTER EXPONENT</b> specifies the power to which the pressure at a junction is raised when computing the flow issuing from an emitter. The default is 0.5.

\b QUALITY selects the type of water quality analysis to perform. The choices are <b>NONE, CHEMICAL, AGE</b>, and \b TRACE. In place of \b CHEMICAL the actual name of the chemical can be used followed by its concentration units (e.g., <b>CHLORINE mg/L</b>). If \b TRACE is selected it must be followed by the ID label of the node being traced. The default selection is \b NONE (no water quality analysis).

\b DIFFUSIVITY is the molecular diffusivity of the chemical being analyzed relative to that of chlorine in water. The default value is 1.0. Diffusivity is only used when mass transfer limitations are considered in pipe wall reactions. A value of 0 will cause EPANET to ignore mass transfer limitations.

\b TOLERANCE is the difference in water quality level below which one can say that one parcel of water is essentially the same as another. The default is 0.01 for all types of quality analyses (chemical, age (measured in hours), or source tracing (measured in percent)).

\b MAP is used to supply the name of a file containing coordinates of the network's nodes so that a map of the network can be drawn. It is not used for any hydraulic or water quality computations.

__Remarks:__
1. All options assume their default values if not explicitly specified in this section.

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; LIMITING POTENTIAL&nbsp; </b>&nbsp; _value_

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; ROUGHNESS CORRELATION&nbsp; </b>&nbsp; _value_

__Definitions:__

\b ORDER is used to set the order of reactions occurring in the bulk fluid, at the pipe wall, or in tanks, respectively. Values for wall reactions must be either 0 or 1. If not supplied the default reaction order is 1.0.

\b GLOBAL is used to set a global value for all bulk reaction coefficients (pipes and tanks) or for all pipe wall coefficients. The default value is zero.

<b>BULK, WALL,</b> and \b TANK are used to override the global reaction coefficients for specific pipes and tanks.

<b>LIMITING POTENTIAL</b> specifies that reaction rates are proportional to the difference between the current concentration and some limiting potential value.

<b>ROUGHNESS CORRELATION</b> will make all default pipe wall reaction coefficients be related to pipe roughness in the following manner:
|Head Loss Equation|Roughness Correlation|
|------------------|---------------------|
|Hazen-Williams    | <b>F / C</b>        |
|Darcy-Weisbach    | <b>F / log(e/D)</b> |
|Chezy-Manning     | <b>F * n</b>        |

where \b F = roughness correlation, \b C = Hazen-Williams C-factor, \b e = Darcy-Weisbach roughness, \b D = pipe diameter, and \b n = Chezy-Manning roughness coefficient. The default value computed this way can be overridden for any pipe by using the \b WALL format to supply a specific value for the pipe.

__Definitions:__

\b PAGESIZE sets the number of lines written per page of the output report. The default is 0, meaning that no line limit per page is in effect.

\b FILE supplies the name of a file to which the output report will be written (ignored by the Windows version of EPANET). The default is to write the report to the project's @ref RptFile file.

\b STATUS determines whether a hydraulic status report should be generated. If \b YES is selected the report will identify all network components that change status during each time step of the simulation. If \b FULL is selected, then the status report will also include information from each trial of each hydraulic analysis. This level of detail is only useful for de-bugging networks that become hydraulically unbalanced. The default is \b NO.

\b SUMMARY determines whether a summary table of number of network components and key analysis options is generated. The default is \b YES.

\b ENERGY determines if a table reporting average energy usage and cost for each pump is provided. The default is \b NO.

\b NODES identifies which nodes will be reported on. You can either list individual node ID labels or use the keywords \b NONE or \b ALL. Additional \b NODES lines can be used to continue the list. The default is \b NONE.

\b LINKS identifies which links will be reported on. You can either list individual link ID labels or use the keywords \b NONE or \b ALL Additional \b LINKS lines can be used to continue the list. The default is \b NONE.

The _variable_ reporting option is used to identify which quantities are reported on, how many decimal places are displayed, and what kind of filtering should be used to limit output reporting. Node variables that can be reported on include:
- \b Elevation
- \b Demand
- \b Head
- \b Pressure
- \b Quality

Link variables include:
- \b Length
- \b Diameter
- \b Flow
- \b Velocity
- \b Headloss
- \b State (same as status: open, active, closed)
- \b Setting (roughness for pipes, speed for pumps, pressure/flow setting for valves)
- \b Reaction (reaction rate)
- \b F-Factor (friction factor).

The default quantities reported are <b>Demand, Head, Pressure,</b> and \b Quality for nodes and <b>Flow, Velocity,</b> and \b Headloss for links. The default precision is two decimal places.

__Remarks:__
1. All options assume their default values if not explicitly specified in this section.
2. Items offset by slashes (/) indicate allowable choices.
3. The default is to not report on any nodes or links, so a \b NODES or \b LINKS option must be supplied if you wish to report results for these items.

__Example:__

The following example reports on nodes N1, N2, N3, and N17 and all links with velocity above 3.0. The standard node variables (Demand, Head, Pressure, and Quality) are reported on while only Flow, Velocity, and F-Factor (friction factor) are displayed for links.

@page ResvPage [RESERVOIRS]

__Purpose:__

Defines all reservoir nodes contained in the network.

__Format:__

One line for each reservoir containing:
- ID label
- Head, ft (m)
- Head pattern ID (optional)

__Remarks:__
1. Head is the hydraulic head (elevation + pressure head) of water in the reservoir.
2. A head pattern can be used to make the reservoir head vary with time.
3. At least one reservoir or tank must be contained in the network.

__Example:__
```

/**
@page RulesPage [RULES]

__Purpose:__

Defines rule-based controls which modify links based on a combination of conditions.

__Format:__

Each rule is a series of statements of the form:

  <B>RULE</B> &nbsp; _ruleID_ <br>
  <B>IF</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _condition_1_ <br>
  <B>AND</B> &nbsp; _condition_2_ <br>
  <B>OR</B> &nbsp; &nbsp; _condition_3_ <br>

  <B>AND</B> &nbsp; _action_2_ <br>
  etc. <br>
  <B>ELSE</B> &nbsp;_action_3_ <br>
  <B>AND</B> &nbsp; _action_4_ <br>
  etc. <br>
  <B>PRIORITY</B> _value_ <br>

where:
<table style = "border: 0px solid black">
<tr> <td><I>ruleID</I></td> <td> = </td> <td> &nbsp;an ID label assigned to the rule</td> </tr>
<tr> <td><I>conditon_n</I></td> <td> = </td> <td> &nbsp;a @subpage ConditionClauses "condition clause"</td> </tr>
<tr> <td><I>action_n</I></td> <td> = </td> <td> &nbsp;an @subpage ActionClauses "action clause"</td> </tr>
<tr> <td><B>PRIORITY</B></td> <td> = </td> <td> &nbsp;a priority value (e.g., a number from 1 to 5)</td> </tr>
</table>

__Remarks:__
1. Only the <B>RULE, IF</B> and <B>THEN</B> portions of a rule are required; the other portions are optional.
2. When mixing <B>AND</B> and <B>OR</B> clauses, the <B>OR</B> operator has higher precedence than <B>AND</B>, i.e.,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `IF A or B and C` <br>
 is equivalent to<br>  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `IF (A or B) and C` <br>
 If the interpretation was meant to be<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `IF A or (B and C)`<br>
 then this can be expressed using two rules as in<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  `IF A THEN ...`  <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  `IF B and C THEN ...`  <br>
3. The <B>PRIORITY</B> value is used to determine which rule applies when two or more rules require that conflicting actions be taken on a link. A rule without a priority value always has a lower priority than one with a value. For two rules with the same priority value, the rule that appears first is given the higher priority.

__Example:__
```
[RULES]
RULE 1
IF   TANK   1 LEVEL ABOVE 19.1
THEN PUMP 335 STATUS IS CLOSED
AND  PIPE 330 STATUS IS OPEN 

RULE 2
IF   SYSTEM CLOCKTIME >= 8 AM
AND  SYSTEM CLOCKTIME < 6 PM
AND  TANK 1 LEVEL BELOW 12
THEN PUMP 335 STATUS IS OPEN 

RULE 3
IF   SYSTEM CLOCKTIME >= 6 PM
OR   SYSTEM CLOCKTIME < 8 AM
AND  TANK 1 LEVEL BELOW 14
THEN PUMP 335 STATUS IS OPEN

/**
@page SourcesPage [SOURCES]

__Purpose:__

Defines locations of water quality sources.

__Format:__

One line for each water quality source containing:
- Node ID label
- Source type (<b>CONCEN, MASS, FLOWPACED, or SETPOINT</b>)
- Baseline source strength
- Time pattern ID (optional)

__Remarks:__
1. For \b MASS type sources, strength is measured in mass flow per minute. All other types measure source strength in concentration units.
2. Source strength can be made to vary over time by specifying a time pattern.
3. A \b CONCEN source:
   - represents the concentration of any external source inflow to the node
   - applies only when the node has a net negative demand (water enters the network at the node)
   - if the node is a junction, reported concentration is the result of mixing the source flow and inflow from the rest of the network
   - if the node is a reservoir, the reported concentration is the source concentration
   - if the node is a tank, the reported concentration is the internal concentration of the tank
   - is best used for nodes that represent source water supplies or treatment works (e.g., reservoirs or nodes assigned a negative demand)
   - do not use at storage tanks with simultaneous inflow/outflow.
4. A <b>MASS, FLOWPACED, or SETPOINT</b> source:
   - represents a booster source, where the substance is injected directly into the network regardless of what the demand at the node is
   - affects water leaving the node to the rest of the network in the following way:
     - a \b MASS booster adds a fixed mass flow to that resulting from inflow to the node
     - a \b FLOWPACED booster adds a fixed concentration to the resultant inflow concentration at the node
     - a \b SETPOINT booster fixes the concentration of any flow leaving the node (as long as the concentration resulting from the inflows is below the setpoint)
   - the reported concentration at a junction or reservoir booster source is the concentration that results after the boosting is applied; the reported concentration for a tank with a booster source is the internal concentration of the tank
   - is best used to model direct injection of a tracer or disinfectant into the network or to model a contaminant intrusion.
5. A \b [SOURCES] section is not needed for simulating water age or source tracing.

/**
@page StatusPage [STATUS]

__Purpose:__

Defines initial status of selected links at the start of a simulation.

__Format:__

One line per link being controlled containing:
- Link ID label
- Status or setting

__Remarks:__
1. Links not listed in this section have a default status of \b OPEN (for pipes and pumps) or \b ACTIVE (for valves).
2. The Status value assigned in this section can be \b OPEN or \b CLOSED. For control valves (e.g., PRVs, FCVs, etc.) this means that the valve is either fully opened or closed, not active at its control setting.
3. The Setting value can be a speed setting for pumps or valve setting for valves.
4. The initial status of pipes can also be set in the @ref PipesPage section.
5. Check valves cannot have their status be preset.
6. Use @ref CtrlsPage or @ref RulesPage to change status or setting at some future point in the simulation.
7. If a \b CLOSED or \b OPEN control valve is to become \b ACTIVE again, then its pressure or flow setting must be specified in the control or rule that reactivates it.

__Example:__
@code

- Minimum water level, ft (m)
- Maximum water level, ft (m)
- Nominal diameter, ft (m)
- Minimum volume, cubic ft (cubic meters)
- Volume curve ID (optional)
- Overflow indicator (<b>YES / NO</b>) (optional)

__Remarks:__
1. Water surface elevation equals bottom elevation plus water level.
2. Non-cylindrical tanks can be modeled by specifying a curve of volume versus water depth in the @ref CurvesPage section.
3. If a volume curve is supplied the diameter value can be any non-zero number
4. Minimum volume (tank volume at minimum water level) can be zero for a cylindrical tank or if a volume curve is supplied.
5. If the overflow indicator is \b YES then the tank is allowed to overflow once it reaches it maximum water level. The default is no overflow.
6. If the tank does not use a volume curve then an asterisk (*) can be used as a placeholder for it if an overflow indicator is specified.
7. A network must contain at least one tank or reservoir.

__Definitions:__

\b DURATION is the duration of the simulation. Use 0 to run a single period snapshot analysis. The default is 0.

<b>HYDRAULIC TIMESTEP</b> determines how often a new hydraulic state of the network is computed. If greater than either the \b PATTERN or \b REPORT time step it will be automatically reduced. The default is 1 hour.

<b>QUALITY TIMESTEP</b> is the time step used to track changes in water quality throughout the network. The default is 1/10 of the hydraulic time step.

<b>RULE TIMESTEP</b> is the time step used to check for changes in system status due to activation of rule-based controls between hydraulic time steps. The default is 1/10 of the hydraulic time step.

<b>PATTERN TIMESTEP</b> is the interval between time periods in all time patterns. The default is 1 hour.

<b>PATTERN START</b> is the time offset at which all patterns will start. For example, a value of 6 hours would start the simulation with each pattern in the time period that corresponds to hour 6. The default is 0.

<b>REPORT TIMESTEP</b> sets the time interval between which output results are reported. The default is 1 hour.

<b>REPORT START</b> is the length of time into the simulation at which output results begin to be reported. The default is 0.

<b>START CLOCKTIME</b> is the time of day (e.g., 3:00 PM) at which the simulation begins. The default is 12:00 AM midnight.

\b STATISTIC determines what kind of statistical post-processing should be done on the time series of simulation results generated. \b AVERAGED reports a set of time-averaged results, \b MINIMUM reports only the minimum values, \b MAXIMUM the maximum values, and \b RANGE reports the difference between the minimum and maximum values. \b NONE reports the full time series for all quantities for all nodes and links and is the default.

__Remarks:__
1. Units can be <b>SECONDS (SEC), MINUTES (MIN), HOURS</b>, or \b DAYS. The default is \b HOURS.
2. If no units are supplied, then time values can be expressed in either decimal hours or in hours:minutes notation.
